# CustomRumble

Set each team's possible items! You can set one team to have all plungers and the other all spikes! Or make one team have no powerups as they get booted by the other. Only the match host needs the plugin. Compatible with Rocket Plugin's custom rumble alterations as well. You could give a team super strong tornados!

**WARNING** Must be used with the default rumble mutator. If you choose spring loaded and select the Freezer for a team, you could have the game freeze instead

Made with help from ItsBrank. TY Brank \<3

Requires an ItsBrank RLSDK generated to build. Unfortunately I cannot share how to generate but this is the repo. [https://github.com/ItsBranK/UE3SDKGenerator](https://github.com/ItsBranK/UE3SDKGenerator)
Also uses a memory namespace based off of Brank's [CodeRed](https://github.com/CodeRedModding/CodeRed-Universal)

Plugin commissioned by [Lethamyr](https://youtube.com/c/Lethamyr)

If you have a great idea and need an implementation DM or add me as friend on discord JerryTheBee#1117! I do plugin commissions just like this one!
